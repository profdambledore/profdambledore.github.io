            Prototype Simulator Game where you manage your own pub / bar.
        </h1>
        <h4>
            I created a simulation game where you manager your own bar, serving customers their orders as they sit down to have some drinks to relax.<br />
            The game features a Sims-esc level creation tool which allows you to place different pieces of furniture in the world if you can afford them.<br />
            Additionally, you can inspect certain furniture items (such as the Bar) to do different things with them.<br />
            In this version of the prototype, their are two different drink items that the player can serve to their customers - a beer and a cider.<br />
            The customer is always right, so when an order is created, only the correct item is served.<br />
            Most meshes in the game are from the SyntyStudios pack Shops.<br />
        </h4>
        <h4>
            When customers find their own table, they go to the bar to buy one of the available products.  When they have been served, they return to their table.<br />
            The staff members man the bar until they receive an order to create a drink for a customer.  They proceed to serve the correct drink to the customer.<br />
            Clicking on the bar will swap the UI to an inspect mode, allowing the player to re-fill it's inventory of product.  Each time an order is served, the item is taken out of this inventory.<br />
        </h4>
        <h4>
            I plan to continue work on this project after my degree is finished.  There is a far range where I can take this project, including adding a full-scale building editor for example.
